---> Hi, I manage a few Unifi AP's and looking for a way to automate the process for changing the WPA password.  Previously the new password was mailed to all internal users but many didn't read the message and started calling the helpdesk for assistance.  Even when they did read the mail about the password change, they somehow didn't remember where to set their wifi password.  I need to avoid future helpdesk overloads, and was looking for a way to automate the password change and push it silently to all laptops, without user intervention needed.  Can the API be used for this ?  Thanks .  Joeri Michiels
